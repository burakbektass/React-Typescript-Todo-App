# 🚀 Practice - My First React+TypeScript Adventure!

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to one of my first React projects. It might not be the fanciest app out there, but it holds a special place in my heart as it marks the beginning of my React journey! 

## 🌱 The Story Behind

This project was born during my early days of learning React. While it might seem simple now - just a basic todo app - it was a huge achievement for me back then! Every component I created, every state I managed, and every TypeScript error I solved (after hours of Googling 😅) taught me something new.

## ✨ What's Inside?

This project was my playground for learning:
- ⚛️ React 18 (my first steps into the React world!)
- 📘 TypeScript (oh boy, those types were confusing at first)
- 🎨 Ant Design (because who doesn't love pre-built components?)
- 💅 Sass styling (my first time moving beyond basic CSS)
- 🔄 Axios for API calls (learning async operations was mind-blowing)

## 🎯 What Does It Do?

It's a humble todo app that:
- Lets you add todos
- Check them off
- Delete them
- ...and that's pretty much it! 😄

Simple? Yes! But it taught me the fundamentals that I use every day now.

## 🏃‍♂️ Want to Try It Out?

If you're also learning React, feel free to clone and play around with it:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000` and voilà! 🎉

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Launches the development server
- `npm test` - Runs the test suite
- `npm run build` - Creates a production build
- `npm run eject` - One-way operation to customize build tool

## 📦 Tech Stack

### Core Stuff
- React 18.2.0 (the new stuff!)
- TypeScript 4.8.3 (for those sweet type checks)
- Ant Design 4.23.1 (because I was tired of styling buttons)
